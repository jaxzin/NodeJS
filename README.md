NodeJS
======
This is some sample code to demonstrate how to use gradle to bootstrap and wrap Node.js packaging.

* installNPM retrieves a mac64 installation of node
* uploadArchives loads this to a local repo as a jar
* The current build task tests that this jar can be resolved
* Next - unjar and run the ndm tool
